# Restaurant Recommendation Model

## 🍽️ Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Restaurant Recommendation Model. The project involves collecting restaurant data from the Swiggy website using web scraping techniques, cleaning the data using Python and pandas, building a Random Forest Regressor Model to predict restaurant prices. The project also includes an interactive webpage built using the Flask library to provide user-friendly recommendations and insights.

## 👩‍💻 Skills

- Python
- Data Cleaning
- Machine Learning

## 🌐 Web Scraping

- Scraped the Swiggy website with the Selenium library to predict the average price based on Cuisine and Location.

## 📊 EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

- Handled noise, null values, and duplicates.
- Performed outlier analysis.

## 🤖 Machine Learning

- Built a RandomForestRegressor model to predict the average price.
- Converted categorical columns into numerical using Label Encoding.

## 🌐 Webpage

- Built a user-friendly webpage connected to a model that predicts average prices.

## 📈 Dashboard

- Created a Dashboard that provides more insights.
- Implemented slicers to allow users to extract the required information.

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Ice creams and desserts are the most popular cuisines.
- North Indian cuisine is the most expensive based on the data.

## 🚧 Limitations

- Limited data about users or items, making it difficult to give accurate recommendations.
- Challenges with real-time updates, such as user preferences or changing item availability.
- Handling sensitive user data, prioritizing privacy.
- Recommendations made more understandable and transparent.

## 📝 Conclusion

In summary, the project achieved its objective of assisting users in making informed dining choices by scraping Swiggy data and employing advanced models like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. The Random Forest Regressor model outshone others with an impressive accuracy in predicting menu prices and suggesting suitable restaurants.
